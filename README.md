# Claw_Bank
End of Term Project

The claw machine bank is a mechatronics system which contains both software and

mechanical components to imitate an arcade claw machine. The claw machine aspect provides an

entertainment factor to encourage the user to save money by storing the spare change used to

activate the claw machine. This device may also be used as a fundraising tool or for general

entertainment without having to pay for every round at an arcade claw machine. This product

will be an economical, entertaining, and rewarding form of motivation to conserve money.

The aim of this project is to help the user save money in an entertaining way by creating

functional claw machine that stores the money inserted in an accessible compartment, like a

piggy bank.
